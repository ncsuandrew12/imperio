# INTRODUCTION

The Imperio options library provides an easy way for Java applications to
process command-line arguments without having to reproduce common logic. It
allows applications to easily implement both single-char POSIX-style and
long-form arguments.

# EXAMPLES

For reference, there are example applications and Eclipse projects located here:

[projects/examples](projects/examples)

These examples mostly revolve around implementing the "echo" Unix utility using
the Options library.

For detailed explanations of the example applications, see the included
